Exploring the driving mechanism of land-use distribution is one of the foundations to ensure sustainable urban development. Industrial parks have great significance in coordinating industrial land with other types of land use for human settlements and economic development. This paper examines the development decisions of industrial parks from the perspective of complex systems by constructing a general framework for simulating the dynamics where develop a multi-agent model (LUL-IV, Land Use Layout – Industrial Vision) based on the NetLogo Platform. The research combines government land-use control policy from the macro perspective with the developer’s decision-making behavior from the micro perspective. Based on the evaluation of land-use suitability, we set the different behavioral rules for different subjects according to the demand for living space. In this study, the model defines three agents, including government, developers and residents, to generate the land-use distribution of Tianfo Health Industrial Park in Shandong Province. Furthermore, the results can be used as a tool to support planning decisions.
