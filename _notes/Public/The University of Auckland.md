<p><strong>介绍：</strong>We research the origin, evolution, and adaptation of life on Earth, the adaptation of tropical islands to climate change, and the use of proxy records for paleoenvironmental change. If humanity continues along its current trajectory of consumption and production, the 21st century will likely produce an environment more threatened than we have ever experienced. In many parts of the world, ecosystem services are already at risk, with defences against natural hazards and climate change near their limits. Using records of past environments, previous environmental change, and extreme environmental events, we seek to answer some of the critical questions facing the world today. More detailed research topics are available on the website.</p>

<p><strong>介绍：</strong>Research in political ecology and environmental justice can influence environmental disputes and feed into policy implementation. They suggest that environmental conflicts, resource scarcity, and the potential for environmental enhancement are socially constructed and not inherently biophysical or local. Our analyses critique environmental management, biopolitical interventions and their socio-cultural implications. Particularly for equity, Indigenous environmental claims, community capacities, and public participation. These findings feed into environmental policy, reconciliation, legal diversity, and sustainability. Our research topics include Environmental management and conservation, Collaborative natural resource management, The political ecology of conservation and restoration, Sustainability and environmental justice, Indigenism, indigeneity and (post) colonialism, Environmental politics of Treaty settlement, etc.</p>

<p><strong>介绍：</strong>Our research examines the changing nature of population dynamics and the multiple aspects of wellbeing and mobility. Movement is central to human existence, whether it be literal travel or metaphorical journeys. Our work draws on modern geographical theory by adopting multiple methods of enquiry. In particular, we ask questions such as - how does mobility shape population dynamics, health, and wellbeing? We consider how mobility influences the nature of a place and vice versa - do the characteristics of places influence populations, and outcomes for human livelihood and wellbeing?

<p><strong>介绍：</strong>We investigate how biophysical systems operate in urban areas and the role of humans in stimulating urban ecosystems processes. The world is rapidly urbanising, creating unique urban ecosystems that are the subject of this research theme. We study terrestrial, aquatic and atmospheric processes through a broad array of techniques that integrate ecology, chemistry and hydrology. Our research seeks to maximise environmental and human well-being and has direct implications for the governance, design and restoration of urban ecosystems. Our research topics include The functional response of streams to urbanisation, Urban forests, above and below ground carbon accumulation, Atmospheric CO2 dynamics in a residential area, Urban atmospheres, Air pollution, etc. More detailed research topics are available on the website.</p>

<p><strong>介绍：</strong>We consider the many lived experiences of social spaces, inequality and social difference (race, class, gender, age, sexuality), and the potential for progressive change in the worlds we inhabit. Our investigations also study the social experiences of a range of more-than-urban spaces and processes; from households to asylums, migration, post-disaster, and cultural diversity. We draw on ideas and approaches from geography and the broader social sciences to ask what creates the intersection and divergence of the urban and the social in analytical, practical and political terms.

    <p><strong>Prof. Meg Parsons：</strong>My research spans human geography, historical studies, and Indigenous studies. This transdisciplinary approach stems from my mixed heritage (Māori/Pākehā/Lebanese) and experiences growing up in small-town Aotearoa New Zealand. My work explores how identities, values, histories, and knowledge systems shape relationships between communities and their environments. It addresses the impacts of colonialism, social-environmental crises, and perceptions of healthy people and places. <a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/meg-parsons" target="_blank">Personal website</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Prof. Robin Kearns：</strong>My interests lie broadly in social and cultural geography, focusing on the connections between place and wellbeing. My research involves collaboration with diverse scholars to explore these themes. As an MA student at the University of Auckland in the early 1980s, I researched community dynamics and land use change in rural Northland, the region of my childhood. A Canadian Commonwealth Scholarship then took me to McMaster University in Ontario, where I studied political economy and quantitative analysis within Geography. <a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/r-kearns" target="_blank">Personal website</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Prof. Tom Baker：</strong>I joined the School of Environment as a Lecturer in Human Geography in 2015. Before coming to Auckland, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Geography at Simon Fraser University, Canada, and worked in national and local government. I received my PhD in 2014 from the University of Newcastle, Australia. <a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/Tom-Baker" target="_blank">Personal website</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Prof. JC Gaillard：</strong>My work focuses on participatory mapping and community-based disaster risk reduction training for NGOs, civil society organizations, communities, and local governments. <a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/jc-gaillard" target="_blank">Personal website</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Prof. Jennifer Salmond：</strong>Her research focuses on studying the meteorological controls on urban air pollution, urban climate risk, and quantifying human exposure to air pollution. She collaborates with experts from various fields and works on developing novel instrumentation, field measurement, and modeling approaches. With a critical physical geography perspective, Jennifer emphasizes a reflective approach to research, addressing implicit and explicit assumptions in theoretical frameworks, methodological approaches, and the actualization of knowledge. <a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/j-salmond" target="_blank">Personal website</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Prof. Luitgard Schwendenmann：</strong>For my MSc (Resources Engineering, University of Karlsruhe, Germany), I studied sediment nutrient flow in a mangrove ecosystem in Brazil. For my PhD (University of Goettingen, Germany), I investigated the belowground carbon dynamics of a tropical forest in Costa Rica. After my PhD, I was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Wyoming (USA), where I examined the impact of land use change on soil carbon cycling and trace gas fluxes in Panama. Before joining the University of Auckland in 2010, I was a research fellow at the University of Goettingen, Germany, studying water uptake patterns in tree plantations and cacao agroforests in Panama and Indonesia. <a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/l-schwendenmann" target="_blank">Personal website</a>.</p>
