<p>We believe that physical design and social environment are interrelated, and that best practice and research should reflect this interconnectedness. All of the school's programs benefit from a collaborative cross-disciplinary environment among faculty and students. Our mission is to create and preserve a sustainable built environment that promotes social justice, cultural value, resource conservation, and economic opportunity.</p>
