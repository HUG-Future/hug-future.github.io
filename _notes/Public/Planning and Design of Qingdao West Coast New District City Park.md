The plot belongs to the urban park green space and is located in the west of Guzhenkou University Campus, West Coast New District, Qingdao, Shandong Province. Because the original surrounding environment is dominated by farming fields, the east is close to the university science and technology park, and it is also a functional transition zone and a greening separation zone. In the future development, it will gradually transition from ecological green space to public leisure activities. There are a large number of fruit trees and fields in the site, and there are many gullies and natural water systems, which can be used. The program positions the base as a valley that is homogeneous at all levels (social and economic level, physical entity level, urban cultural level, etc.), and can integrate various aspects to improve the integrity of the entire area. In the design, a design methodology based on the study of social development, physical venues and activities, and the deconstruction and reorganization of the base was explored.
