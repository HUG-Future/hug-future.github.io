    <h2 id="The Department of Human Geography，人文地理学系">🏫1 <a href="https://www.keg.lu.se/en/start" target="_blank">The Department of Human Geography，人文地理学系</a></h2>
<p><strong>介绍：</strong>Research and education in human geography addresses social, cultural, political and economic processes of change and their spatial expressions and consequences for people at different scales, whether local, regional or global. The key areas of research and teaching at the department are cultural geography, urban and social geography, economic geography, development geography and GIS. Our staff and students make use of a variety of research methods, with an emphasis on mixed-methods approaches and fieldwork. All our teachers are active researchers in their fields to the mutual benefit of both teaching and research.</p>

<h4 id="PhD in Human Geography">1.1.1 <a href="https://www.keg.lu.se/en/research/phd-education/phd-human-geography" target="_blank">PhD in Human Geography</a></h4>
<p><strong>介绍：</strong>At present around fifteen Ph.D. candidates are pursuing their Ph.D.s at the Department within the different research groups found at the Department. Ph.D. positions are financed by the Department, or through external funding, with most Ph.D. projects being funded externally. Since the amount of external funding varies from one year to another it is very difficult to predict when opportunities for Ph.D. positions become available and in what sub-fields they are opened. To be able to provide supervision, the Department only admits Ph.D. candidates within fields of current research. It is not possible to be admitted to the Ph.D. programme without being fully financed. The Department only handles Ph.D. applications in relation to advertised positions. Ph.D. positions are advertised through the Lund University website. <a href="https://www.keg.lu.se/en/research/phd-education/phd-human-geography" target="_blank">Link to PhD information</a>.</p>

<h4 id="Master's in Human Geography">1.2.1 <a href="https://www.keg.lu.se/en/start" target="_blank">Master's in Human Geography</a></h4>
<p><strong>介绍：</strong>The master programme in Human Geography prepares you for a wide range of professions in public service, non-governmental organisations and the private sector. Human Geography is about the ways in which spaces, places and environments are both the condition for and the consequence of human activities. As human geographers, we take a broad view on human activities as cultural, economic, social, political and environmental, and we approach topics from distinctly geographical perspectives. Human geographers add sensitivity to space and place to social, gender, political, economic and environmental enquiry, and we frequently draw on elements from the natural sciences and the humanities.</p>

<p><strong>介绍：</strong>The research in this group deals principally with tracking the supply, demand, connectivities and flows of land-based natural resources and ecosystem services in the Anthropocene. We are also interested in understanding how these patterns relate to and interact with the Earth system and the consequences this has for the equitable distribution of resources. Though the work at the department on this topic is mostly empirical, the researchers have a strong interest in theories, models, and perspectives that support interpretation of the observations, and in using observations to test theories and models.</p>
