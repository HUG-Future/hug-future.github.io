From 2019 to 2020, the novel coronavirus has swept the world in a short period of time. Everyone's life has been changed as a result, and global economic development has been severely affected. This phenomenon of large-scale acute infectious disease transmission puts forward higher requirements for urban and social governance: how to give early warning and respond to changes in the epidemic situation, how to improve the efficiency of information collection and transmission, how to ensure the precise docking of emergency protection measures, and how to avoid as much as possible casualties and losses. All the problems point to a comprehensive response system capable of dealing with sudden acute infectious diseases, that is, "multi-scale intelligent monitoring and early warning system for sudden acute infectious diseases".
