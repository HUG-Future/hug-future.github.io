With the improvement of China's economic level, the demand for healthy living is getting higher and higher at this stage. At the same time, governments at all levels have also continuously introduced policies to promote the development of health industry. The demand for health industry parks has also increased. The project is located in Jvnan County, Linyi City, Shandong Province. The site is located in the vicinity of Liushan Village and Shiquanhu Reservoir in Jvnan County. The planned area is 200hm, including construction land of 158.43hm. In the project, the developer hopes to build a high-standard health industrial park based on the local superior natural conditions. The project site is three kilometers away from the urban area of Jvnan County, about 20 minutes drive from the People's Government of nan County, and about half an hour drive from Weinan Railway Station. Therefore, in the direction of the future development of Jvnan County in the north, the project occupies an important position. In this plan, the concept of "Smart City" was introduced, and a PSS (Planning Support System) based on land suitability analysis and multi-agent simulation was designed. This is a research and attempt to develop industrial parks under the framework of "Smart City"

Exploring the driving mechanism of land-use distribution is one of the foundations to ensure sustainable urban development. Industrial parks have great significance in coordinating industrial land with other types of land use for human settlements and economic development. This paper examines the development decisions of industrial parks from the perspective of complex systems by constructing a general framework for simulating the dynamics where develop a multi-agent model (LUL-IV, Land Use Layout – Industrial Vision) based on the NetLogo Platform. The research combines government land-use control policy from the macro perspective with the developer’s decision-making behavior from the micro perspective. Based on the evaluation of land-use suitability, we set the different behavioral rules for different subjects according to the demand for living space. In this study, the model defines three agents, including government, developers and residents, to generate the land-use distribution of Tianfo Health Industrial Park in Shandong Province. Furthermore, the results can be used as a tool to support planning decisions.
