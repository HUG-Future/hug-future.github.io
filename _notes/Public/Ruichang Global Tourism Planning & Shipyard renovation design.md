The project is located in Ruichang City, along the northwestern Yangtze River in Jiangxi Province, with an area of 1,447 km? and a population of 456,307. Ruichang's current economic development mainly relies on the secondary industry, and its momentum has been better in recent years. At the same time, with the development of the economy, the number of employees in the tertiary industry continues to grow. So Ruichang faces the problem of industry restructuring and urbanization. The planning and development of the tourism industry will be focus of industrial restructuring. In our program, we start with the construction of nodes, axes, networks to create a global tourism environment and to enrich the travel experience. Thereby promoting the development of tourism and the adjustment of urban industrial structure.
