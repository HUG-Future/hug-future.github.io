The project is located in the north of Qingdao City, south of Licun River, north of Qingdao Old City, and both sides of the Jiaoji Railway, covering an area of 28.96 ha. Through research, it is found that the urban space around the base is separated from each other, so we hope to make up for the separation of urban space through the reconstruction of the space of the site. In this regard, spatial syntax is an effective quantification tool. At the same time, we have adopted the strategy proposed by the Qingdao Master Plan, through the analysis of urban data, and seized the clue of Jiaoil Railway to explore Qingdao's urban culture. In the future, the block will have various functions such as office, residence, commerce and entertainment. It will become the city entrance of Qingdao Old City. And a beautiful city space shared by citizens and tourists.
