## Internship Experience

**Citory Tech Company Ltd.**

Aug.2018–Nov.2018 Shanghai, China

`Jobs-Housing Balance Analysis:` *Analysed the job-housing balance in Pudong New Area, Shanghai through the cell phone signaling data. Modeled an ideal job-housing balance scene based on the principle of gradient, and compared it with actual data, so as to derive a spatial optimization strategy;*
`Master Plan of Pudong New Area:` *Used machine learning to segment the image of urban street scenes and extract spatial elements (trees, sky, buildings) based on human vision to quantify the spatial quality of the street.*

**Qingdao Tourism Planning and Architecture Design Research Institute**

Nov.2017–Jan.2018 Qingdao, China

`Master Plan of Daotuo Town, Shandong Province:` *With the development of villages and towns as the background, GIS and other technologies are used to analyze the status quo of Daotuo Town and formulate targeted development policies and land use plans.*

**Shandong University of Science and Technology Architecture Design Institute**

Jul.2016–Aug.2016 Qingdao, China

`Linyi Industrial Park Development:` *Through field visits, questionnaire surveys and other methods, combined with computer simulations, the land use planning and urban design plan of the industrial park are formulated.*
